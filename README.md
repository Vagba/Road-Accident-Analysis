Project Title: Road Accident Analysis Dashboard 

Overview:
The Road Accident Analysis Dashboard offers a comprehensive visualization of road accident data, providing insights into accident trends, severity, and contributing factors. The project utilizes a dataset containing road accident records and incorporates various parameters and visualizations to facilitate analysis and decision-making.

Dataset:
The dataset comprises road accident records, including details such as accident date, location, severity, vehicle type, weather conditions, and casualties.

Parameters:

Current Year: Allows users to filter data for the current year, facilitating real-time analysis and comparison.
Previous Year: Enables users to compare current-year data with the previous year for trend analysis and performance evaluation.

Grouped Data:

Vehicle Type: Grouping accidents based on vehicle types provides insights into the involvement of different vehicles in accidents.
Weather Condition: Grouping accidents by weather conditions helps identify the impact of weather on road safety.
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):

The dashboard includes the following KPIs:

Total Accidents: Provides an overview of the total number of accidents recorded within the selected timeframe.
Total Casualties: Summarizes the total number of casualties resulting from accidents.
Fatal Casualties: Highlights the number of fatalities recorded in accidents.
Slight Casualties: Indicates the number of slight injuries reported in accidents.

Visualizations:

The dashboard features a variety of visualizations to facilitate data exploration and analysis:

Sparklines: Utilized to display trends in accident severity over time, allowing users to identify patterns and fluctuations.
Map Visualization: Geospatial representation of accidents, providing insights into accident hotspots and distribution across regions.

Pie Chart: illustrates the distribution of accident severity categories (e.g., fatal, serious, slight) across various weather conditions.

Bar Chart: depicts the distribution of accident severity categories across different road surface types, enabling users to compare the impact of road conditions on accident severity.
